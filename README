# Setup

## Install ruby 
https://rvm.io or similar.  This was written using ruby 2.6.3

## Install dependencies: 

    bundle install

## Run the app: 

    ruby app.rb

## Run tests 

    rspec spec


# Docker setup (If containers are your kind of thing)

    docker build -t samsonasu/gradeapp .
    docker run -it samsonasu/gradeapp

# TODO

List of development tasks I would prioritized next: 
  1. Re-do the user interfact - the menu system is clunky
    - Switch to a free-form /shorthand input, e.g. teacher types "32 F in C = -5 # => INCORRECT"
  2. Make a web interface
    - So many more options not in the CLI for a good UX
  3. Add integration tests - current there are no UI tests for app.rb
    
Features I would add: 
  - As an instructor, in order to save time, I want to enter all the questions once up front and then enter multiple student reponses
  - As an instructor, I want the total score for the student's worksheet to be calculated after I enter all their answers.
